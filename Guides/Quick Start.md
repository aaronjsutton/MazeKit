#  MazeKit Quick Start Guide

## Introduction

MazeKit uses an implentation of the Depth-First search algorithm to generate random mazes.

## Creating Mazes

Create a `Maze` by specifying a width, height, and optional starting point.

```swift
var myMaze = Maze(width: 25, height: 25)
```

> Due to the way that Depth-First Search works, a maze must have an odd number of columns and rows.
> If even values are supplied, the maze will automatically be expanded by 1.

### Generate a Maze

Once you have created a `Maze`,  it can be generated by calling the `Maze.generate()` method.

```swift
myMaze.generate()
```

> The complexity of this algorithm is `O(n)`

## Resetting Mazes

To reset a maze the state it was in at initialization, or to regenerate it completley, use `Maze.reset()`

```swift 
myMaze.reset()
```
Reset `myMaze` to the default state.

```swift
myMaze.reset(regenerate: true)
```
Regenerate `myMaze`

A new starting point can also be specified.
```swift
myMaze.reset(to: Point(row: 5, column: 5))
```

## Using Maze Data

Once a maze is generated, you can access it's data for use in higher-level representations, such
as visual representaion through `SpriteKit`

You can access any point in a maze using `Maze`'s built in subscripts.

```swift
myMaze[2, 2] // -> Space
```
See `Maze.Space` for details on the value that is returned by the subscript.
